### CPSC 120 labs

* Lab 2

    I really liked lab 2 becuase I love math and it taught us hpow to do simple multiplication and division. It sparked my intrest and showed me different ways how we can put code into. I also taught me how to over come simple problmes and use the multiplication and division signs.

* Lab 1

    This was the first lab that i started with and it was really stressful. I had never coded before in my life so when i first did this i was in lala land and was wondering what everything meant and what i was suppose to do. But after figuring stuff out and learning new things as I went i learned that its just like a puzzle and you just have to put the peaces together. I also learned that the only way to get better and know what your doing is PRACTICE.

* Lab 7

    Funny enough, this lab taught me how to play. I had never played and the week after this lab i went to go play at a casino and lost all my money. I wish i never learned how to play so I coulkd still have my hundread bucks.
